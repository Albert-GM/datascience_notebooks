# Notebooks

Here you will find different notebooks concerning data science and machine learning applied to a variety of problems:

- **Multi-class classification problem**. Different machine learning models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, decision tree, random forest, xgboost and neural networks. Using bayesian optimization, keras-tuner and yellowbrick to get machine learning visualizations.

- **Imbalanced classification dataset**. Using different machine learning models, randomizedsearchcv, keras-tuner, yellowbrick and techniques for undersampling and oversampling as SMOTE.
