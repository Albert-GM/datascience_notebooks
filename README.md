# datascience_notebooks

Here you will find different notebooks concerning data science and machine learning applied to a variety of problems:

- Applying machine learning to a multi-class classification problem. You will see different machine learning models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, decision tree, random forest, xgboost and neural networks. Using bayesian optimization, Keras-tuner and yellowbrick to get machine learning visualizations.

- Machine learning applied to an imbalanced classification problem. Using different machine learning models, bayesian optimization, Keras-tuner, yellowbrick and techniques for undersampling and oversampling as SMOTE.
