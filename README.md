Here you will find different notebooks concerning data science and machine learning applied to a variety of problems.

- Applying machine learning to a toy data set. You will see different machine learning models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, decision tree, random forest, xgboost and neural networks. Using bayesian optimization and Keras-tuner.
